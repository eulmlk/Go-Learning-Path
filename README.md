# Implement Unit Testing for Task Management API using testify Library
## Objective
  - The objective of this task is to implement comprehensive unit tests for the Task Management API codebase using the testify library in Go. Unit tests help ensure the correctness of individual components and increase confidence in the stability of the application.

## Instructions
  - Set up a test suite using the testify library to organize and execute unit tests for the Task Management API.
  - Write unit tests to cover critical components of the API, including domain models, use cases, and any complex logic.
  - Use mocking techniques provided by testify to isolate dependencies and ensure test independence.
  - Test various scenarios and edge cases to verify the behavior of each component under different conditions.
  - Include assertions to verify the expected behavior and outcomes of each test case, ensuring thorough coverage.
  - Implement proper setup and teardown procedures for tests to maintain a clean state between test cases.
  - Aim for high test coverage to maximize the effectiveness of unit testing in identifying and preventing bugs.
  - Refactor existing code as necessary to improve testability and maintainability, adhering to Clean Code principles.
  - Integrate unit tests into the CI pipeline to automate testing and ensure code quality with each commit.
  - Document the unit test suite, including instructions for running tests locally, test coverage metrics, and any issues encountered during testing.

  - **Note**:
    - Unit testing is essential for ensuring the reliability and stability of software applications. Focus on writing thorough tests that cover critical components and edge cases to increase confidence in the codebase's correctness.
